# best-exotic-4

## The project
This was an early version of the Best Exotic project. It is a pretty simple site for hosting articles about different topics 
and connecting students to tutors. This site was never deployed. Instead I shifted my efforts to a more ambitious, React 
version with more features.

The notion folder contains my (failed) attempt to create a webclipper for Notion pages.

## Running the site
To run the site, clone the repo and then run these commands in the root directory:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```
